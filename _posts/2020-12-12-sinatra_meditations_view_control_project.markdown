Its close to half way through the Part Time Software Engineering Program at Flatiron School and its insane to think back at the starting point. We have learned so much and is nice to feel absolutely more comfortable writing code. The logic I feel is beginning to stick! The very opposite of the when we were at the first project and it wasn't a pretty sight. 

For the Flatiron Project #2: Sinatra & MVC: Model/View/Controller we were asked to use both to create our own web application. A MVC is a a pattern used to construct a software application and Sinatra a DSL to create web applications. Going back a forth for create the models, views and controllers and working out what will bring up the form onto the browser. We were now using ActiveRecord which I can say makes like so much easier as not methods are a dime a dozen. The find_by methods are built in and its honestly nice to know the logic behind it before we got it easy with ActiveRecord. 


For my project I decided to create MVC/ Sinatra web application that could track someones progress in Daily Meditations. The web applications gives the user the opportunity to track the amount of time they meditated as well as date and whether it was day or night meditation. The hard worker is really in the controllers and it is broken down to CRUD: Create Read Update and Delete through RESTful Routes and Forms with some Sessions in between. I can say I really enjoyed this project and have come to realize, though these projects will always be a little daunting - it really brings all the course work together. Material that wasn't sticking before definitely come out and give you the opporunity to have a better understanding. I hope I don't regret these words when I say it was fun mapping out where each page should go and creating the user experience. My number one advice for future Flatiron students.. Draw It Out.

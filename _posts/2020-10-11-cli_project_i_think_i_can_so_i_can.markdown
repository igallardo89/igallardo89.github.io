We were asked to create a CLI (Command Line Interface) application after 6 weeks in the Part Time Software Engineering program. I have to be honest with you, I was so afraid and had no idea what to expect. As the days got closer we finally arrived to it and it was mainly asking for us to retrieve information by Scaping or a Public API. I would absolutely say when I first started the project back in late September, I had no idea what I was doing. It wasn't particularly like we had alot of time to grasp the idea, and 6 weeks was the complete length of my entire coding career. 

I wanted to do something fun and use an API that would be something I would use or my family would. We are huge and when I say huge I mean it, soccer fans... so huge I feel like I'm going to get introuble for using the word soccer and not futbol. My fiance born and raised in Florence passes all of his free time watching Game Highlights. It would so happened the ScoreBat offered an free Public API for games recently happening. My idea was to provide the list of games for my user and then depending on their choice I'd provide them with game details and url were there can see all the highlights. Great I was so excited and I was ready to start working.

Here is where its hits me. I was hitting the biggest mistake that a student should make ... I was convinced I was going to completely understand and do everything myself. So when I hit blocks, I'd be stubborn to not take advange of Flatiron's 1:1. So when I finally showed my Cohort Lead my CLI... it ran, worked  and did what I wanted but didn't meet requirements. I'd have to start all over again... 

So what do I do I buckled down and I started all over again. This time I broke down worked inch by inch. What ended up happening was so crazy, I didn't expect it. The project is absolutely designed to get you understanding the work. What I was doing, what looking outwards just to get it to run. Going back to the working on it, the right way... I ended understanding terms and lessons I had trouble with in the past. It was pretty rewarding. The first project absolutely gave me that bit of  confidence that I can absolutely can say I lacked 6 weeks ago. It makes me excited for the program ahead and the venture of Software Engineering in my future.

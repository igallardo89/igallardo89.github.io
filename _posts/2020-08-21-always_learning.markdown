Why did you decide to study Software Engineering?

I have always felt in life, if you aren't learning and growing then what are you doing? It is a question I ask and push myself to answer everyday.

I studied Languages, Culture and World Trade at Pace University and moved outside of the United States in hopes of obtaining a better understanding of the world. I found that there are so many differences amongst us. Our differences that we sometimes can allow to disconnect and distracts us from learning from eachother. From my limited knowledge of technology - it is young but powerful. I truly believe it holds great promise in reconnecting us as a community. Once united, we as humanity can work together in achieving a better world for all.

I felt a need to reevulated and explore my opportunities which is when I found the Flatiron School. I would like to be apart of Software Engineering as I believe it creates an opportunity for a better future. I also am convinced as there is consisent growth in the industry, my exploration and curiousity will constantly be fostered.
